# Basic Travel Site

I build this web app to get familier with the modern web development workflow.


**KeyPoints:**
1. Leveraging Node.js tools like NPM and webpack to save time by automating tasks.
2. Enhancing my CSS knowledge with techniques (BEM & PostCSS) to keep my code super-organized and manageable even on larger sites.
3. Deeper dive into JavaScript basics like Object-oriented Programming to write well-structured code using the ES6 module pattern (Babel & webpack).
